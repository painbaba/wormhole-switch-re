# Live peer-active capture (2026-11-06)

Bidirectional `0xD9` HID injection between the two ends of the same cable,
captured simultaneously on both hosts.

**Summary:** complete 16-byte `0xD9` frames are forwarded in both directions. In the same-day re-run, 12 of 12 complete peer→local frames were accepted and forwarded. The 15-byte frames from the original run are rejected by the device. Details below.

- Local host: Wormhole at Bus 3 Dev 15, serial `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0`, `/dev/sg1` (was `/dev/sg2` before re-enum), `usbmon3`
- Peer host: Wormhole at Bus 1 Dev 6, serial `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1`, `/dev/sg9`, `usbmon1` (the second machine; its name and address are left out)

The peer capture's bus holds only the Wormhole and its root hub, so it needed no filtering. The re-run has no peer-side capture (see the re-run section).

## Sanitisation

A `tcpdump -i usbmon<N>` capture records every device on that bus. Besides the Wormhole, the raw live3 capture held:

- Logitech receiver `046d:c548` (3:7): 1,639 interrupt reports, all 9-byte report-ID-2 frames, with no report-ID-1 (keyboard) frames. The byte layout looks like pointer movement, not typing.
- IronKey S200 `1953:0202` (3:14): 138 SCSI commands, all TEST UNIT READY, REQUEST SENSE or `0x4A`.

Neither belongs in a public repo, so the published bus-3 files keep only the Wormhole's packets:

```sh
python3 tools/filter_usbmon.py RAW.pcap --device 3:15 -o captures/OUT.pcap
```

Checked against the raw files: for live3, the 464 Wormhole packets, the 79 SCSI transactions and the 1 HID report are identical. For the re-run, the 342 Wormhole packets and the 12 HID reports are identical. `tools/test_filter_usbmon.py` covers the filter itself.

Since fixed: the working-tree copy of `captures/wormhole_bus3_2026-11-06.pcap` (committed in `e15d291` with 1,688 packets from the Logitech receiver and 342 from the IronKey) is now filtered to the Wormhole. The original blob remains in git history; a rewrite was deferred by owner decision (see `docs/issue-17-sanitise-history.md`).

## Injection sequence

All CDBs built with `tools/wormhole_parse.py:build_vendor_hid_cdb` (`D9 '3'/'4' <12 payload> OT`),
sent with `sg_raw -C 1 /dev/sgX <bytes>` (space-separated, `--cmd-file` is not supported in this sg3-utils build).
Mouse payload = boot-mouse `buttons/X/Y/wheel` in bytes 0–3; keyboard = boot-keyboard `mods/reserved/keys…` in bytes 0–7 (HID usage `0x04='a'`, `0x05='b'`, `0x06='c'`).

| # | From | Packet | sg_raw result |
|---|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | local | mouse `X=+10` `000a…` | Good |
| 2 | local | mouse `X=+20` `0014…` | Good |
| 3 | local | mouse `X=+30` `001e…` | Good |
| 4 | local | click down `01…` / up `00…` | Good ×2 |
| 5–6 | local | kbd `'a'` press/release `000004…` / `000000…` | Good ×2 |
| 7 | peer | mouse `X=+40` `0028…` | **CHECK CONDITION**, sense key 9, `ASC=0xFF/0xFF` |
| 8 | peer | mouse `X=+50` `0032…` | CHECK CONDITION (same sense) |
| 9 | peer | mouse `X=+60` `003c…` | **Good** |
| 10–11 | peer | click down/up | CHECK CONDITION ×2 |
| 12–13 | peer | kbd `'b'` press/release | CHECK CONDITION ×2 |
| 14–15 | local | kbd `'c'` press/release | Good ×2 |
| 16 | peer | wheel `00000001…` | CHECK CONDITION |

## Results (parser: `tools/wormhole_parse.py --hid`)

### Local → peer: clean forwarding

- 9 local CDBs decoded as valid 16-byte `D9` (`footer_ok=True, framing=True`), all `CSW=good`.
- Peer capture shows **9/9 HID reports received, 1:1 with the local send**:
  `EP3 mouse x=+10 / +20 / +30`, click `L=True` then `L=False`,
  `EP4 keyboard keys=[0x4]` then idle, `keys=[0x6]` then idle.
- Between injections, the only Wormhole commands are `0x4A` and `REQUEST SENSE`, in pairs every 2.02 s, on both hosts.

### Peer → local: mostly rejected / truncated

- Peer capture shows 8 `0xD9` CDBs on the wire, but **7 of 8 arrive as 15-byte CDBs** (`d93300280000000000000000004f54` = 15 B, missing one `00` before `OT`; parser `footer_ok=None, framing=False`). Each returns `CSW=CHECK CONDITION`, and the follow-up `REQUEST SENSE` reports `key 9 (Copy Abort), ASC=0xFF/0xFF`. That is the firmware's vendor sense; the parser's "Copy Abort" label is an alias, not a real SPC abort.
- Only `mouse60` arrives as a proper 16-byte CDB (`d933003c000000000000000000004f54`, `footer_ok=True`) with `CSW=good`. It is the only peer packet forwarded: the local host logs **one Wormhole HID report, EP3 mouse `x=+60`**, at raw frame 617.
- The original run did not establish why 7 of the 8 sends went out short. The re-run below shows that sg_raw sends complete 16-byte frames when given them, and that the device accepts them. The short frames most likely came from the original input; the old capture can't show which bytes were typed.

Note on counts: the raw local capture has 1,640 HID reports. 1,639 come from the Logitech receiver (3:7) and 1 from the Wormhole; the published file keeps only the Wormhole's one.

## Re-run: peer → local (same day)

What differs from the original run:

- The peer's capture needs root, and sudo there asks for a password, so this run has no peer-side capture. The sends ran as a normal user through the Wormhole's SCSI node on the peer (`/dev/sg9`).
- Payloads were chosen so nothing typed: net-zero mouse moves (+1 px, then −1 px), an idle mouse report, and an all-zero keyboard report (no key pressed).
- The local host was captured on `usbmon3` for the whole run.
- The driver is `tools/peer_rerun_send.py`. It writes one JSON line per send. Its CDB table is checked against the parser by `tools/test_peer_rerun_send.py`.

| Phase | Path | Gap | Frames | Peer result | Local host |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `sg_raw -C 1` | 2.0 s | 16-byte ×4 | SCSI Good ×4 | 4 matching reports |
| P2 | SG_IO ioctl | 2.0 s | 16-byte ×4 | Good ×4 | 4 matching reports |
| P3 | SG_IO ioctl | 0.25 s | 16-byte ×4 | Good ×4 | 4 matching reports |
| P4 | SG_IO ioctl | 2.0 s | 15-byte ×2 (controls) | CHECK CONDITION ×2, sense key 9, ASC `FF/FF` | none |

Findings:

- All 12 complete frames were accepted and forwarded. Payloads matched the sends 1:1 and in order: mouse `+1`, `−1`, idle, keyboard idle, repeated per phase. The local receive times fall 1–4 ms before the peer's send-log times, so the two clocks agree to a few ms.
- Both 15-byte controls were rejected with the same sense as the original run, and nothing was forwarded.
- No timing guard appeared at 0.25 s spacing. Shorter spacing is untested.
- sg_raw delivered complete 16-byte frames when given complete frames (P1). So the short frames of the original run most likely came from the input, not from sg_raw truncating. The original run didn't record the typed command, so this remains an inference.

Limit: the wire CBW length on the peer was not observed. A complete frame is inferred from the accepted status and the forwarded payloads. A short frame never produces a forwarded report, as P4 shows.

## What this closes / leaves open (`docs/methodology.md`)

- **Closed:** host→cable `0xD9` forwarding to the peer HID interfaces works with no GoBridge/Wormhole software running. `payload[0..3]` → boot-mouse EP3, `payload[0..7]` → boot-keyboard EP4, verified byte-for-byte.
- **Closed:** peer→local forwarding works for complete 16-byte frames: 12 of 12 in the re-run, at 2.0 s and 0.25 s spacing. The 15-byte frames are rejected by the device.
- **Closed (#16):** the original run's 15-byte frames were short sends from the peer host, which the device correctly rejected. See `docs/15-byte-cdb-truncation.md`.
- **Open:** a peer-side wire capture (needs root on the peer), and spacing below 0.25 s.
- **Closed (#15), by inference:** the `bus3_live2` run has one more forwarded report, EP3 `x=+60` at raw frame 849, with no `0xD9` CDBs sent from this host. That capture is unpublished and its peer side was not recorded, so the sender is inferred from the two-end run above: a peer-side injection forwarded by the cable. See `docs/issue-15-mouse60-orphan.md`.
- **Open:** no live UPipe/file/clipboard traffic yet (`candidate UPipe: 0` on every capture), so that path remains unobserved. The capacity anomaly (`docs/capacity-anomaly.md`) and the `GSDD.zz` container (`docs/gsdd.md`) have since been analysed separately.
